# Data-Science-Consulting-Project
 This is a data science side project. Based on the three datasets, we need to find out why our client is churning. We need to test the hypothesis of whether churn is driven by the customers' price sensitivity.<br><br>Based on the data, we would need to engineer features based on the data that we obtain, and build a binary
classification model (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Machines to name a few), picking
the most appropriate model based on the tradeoff between the complexity, the explanability, and the accuracy of
the models. Based on the model picked, we would be able to understand the direction and magnitude of the impact
of prices on churn rates, as well as the relative importance of prices compared to other factors.

I will include my works in Python with Jupytor Notebook and the data I used in this project.
